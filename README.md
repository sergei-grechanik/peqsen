# Equality saturation engine in python

This is an experimental equality saturation engine written in python. It works with more or less
arbitrary finite signatures and sets of rewriting rules. It also supports explanations (not
perfectly though). Its main goal is to support machine learning so that it is possible to learn
rewriting strategies (this part is not implemented yet).

## Experiments

* [Naive boolean term minimization](notebooks/boolean-terms-minimization-01.ipynb)
* [Less naive boolean term minimization](notebooks/boolean-terms-minimization-02.ipynb)
